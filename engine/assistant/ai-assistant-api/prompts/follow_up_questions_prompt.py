    Generate three very brief follow-up questions from your previous answer, something the user would likely ask about the ideas in the Hverfi√∞ mitt participatory budgeting project.
    Use double angle brackets to reference the questions, e.g. <<Are the ideas about cats?>> or <<Tell me more about the dog park idea>>.
    Try not to repeat questions that have already been asked.
    Keep the follow-up question generated very short, at the most 5 to 8 words.
    Never output more than 8 words per each follow-up question.
    Make sure that at least one of the generated follow-up questions is about different types of ideas, like for kids, schools, animals, playgrounds, art, music, etc
    Also make sure at least one of the generated follow-up questions is releated to your previous answer.
    Never generate follow-up questions asking about estimated costs or asking for images.
    Only generate questions and do not generate any text before or after the questions, such as 'Next Questions'"""
